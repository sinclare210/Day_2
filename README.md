# Day 2 of 100 Days of Code (Go Interfaces)

This project is part of my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge.  
On Day 2, I practiced **Go interfaces** by creating two structs (`Book` and `User`) that both implement the same interface.

---

## 📝 What I Learned
- How to define and use **interfaces** in Go.
- Importance of **method signatures matching exactly** for interface implementation.
- Calling methods through an interface instead of directly on structs.
